            <p>I've been a wildlife biologist in Northern California for 10 years. I've caught and tagged salmon in the
                redwoods, surveyed for endangered bird species, and been up to my waist in San Francisco Bay mud looking
                for invasive plants. While I've loved my time as a biologist, I knew I was ready for a new challenge.
                With the encouragement of many friends in the tech industry, I began to learn to code and found that I
                loved it!</p>

            <p> I'm currently enrolled in Rithm School in San Francisco and can't wait to learn as much as I can!</p>
